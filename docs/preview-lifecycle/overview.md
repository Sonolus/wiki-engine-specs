# Preview: Lifecycle

An overview of a Sonolus level's lifecycle during preview.

## Preparation

Preparation runs once and only once before the start of a level, and prepares the runtime for preview.

Preparation consists of early optimization system, preprocessing system, late optimization system, and render system.

### Early Optimization System

Early optimization system is responsible for optimizing nodes to improve code performance.

### Preprocessing System

Preprocessing system is responsible for setting up or modifying blocks to be used throughout the preview.

### Late Optimization System

Late optimization system is responsible for optimizing nodes to further improve code performance.

### Rendering System

Rendering system is responsible for rendering of entities.
