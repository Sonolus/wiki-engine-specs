## Remarks

Arcade scoring normalizes maximum score to `1,000,000`, thus Perfect, Great, and Good score multipliers are relative to each other. For example, the following two multiplier setups are equivalent:

-   Perfect: `1`, Great: `0.8`, Good: `0.5`.
-   Perfect: `100`, Great: `80`, Good: `50`.

Consecutive score multiplier accumulates for every step reached, up to cap. For example using consecutive Perfect score, a multiplier of `0.01`, a step of `10`, and a cap of `50`, will result in increasing Perfect score by `0.01` for every `10` consecutive Perfects reached, up to maximum of `50` consecutive Perfects.
