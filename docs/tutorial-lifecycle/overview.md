# Tutorial: Lifecycle

An overview of a Sonolus level's lifecycle during tutorial.

## Preparation

Preparation runs once and only once before the start of tutorial, and prepares the runtime for tutorial.

Preparation consists of early optimization system, preprocessing system, and late optimization system.

### Early Optimization System

Early optimization system is responsible for optimizing nodes to improve code performance.

### Preprocessing System

Preprocessing system is responsible for setting up or modifying blocks to be used throughout the tutorial.

### Late Optimization System

Late optimization system is responsible for optimizing nodes to further improve code performance.

## Update Cycle

Update cycle runs continuously every frame during tutorial.

Update cycle consists of navigate system, update system, and presentation system.

### Navigate System

Navigate system is responsible for processing user navigation events.

### Update System

Update system is responsible for updating.

### Presentation System

Presentation system is responsible for presenting skin sprites, effect clips, particle effects, and instruction icons.
